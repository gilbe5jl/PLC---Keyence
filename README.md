# PLC---Keyence
Python program for communicating with an Allen-Bradley PLCs using Ethernet/IP and Keyence Vision System Controllers using Ethernet/IP.
The development for this project was aimed at reading/writing data inside an Allen-Bradley PLC and sending that data to a Keyence Vision System Controller.
PLCs can be used to control heavy or dangerous equipment, this code is provided "as is" and makes no guarantees on its reliability in a production environment. This code is being provided as an example of my professional experience and should not be copied or distrubuted.
